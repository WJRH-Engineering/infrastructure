# SIGNAL PATH

WJRH is a hybrid radio station, meaning it broadcasts its content simultaneously
over FM radio and the Internet. FM broadcasting is handled by a transmitter and
antenna on the fifth floor of Pardee, while Internet broadcasting is handled by 
an [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) server hosted by the station's AWS account.
