# WJRH Web Infrastructure

This repository tracks files related to the WJRH web infrastructure as a whole. It contains build scripts for each service in the WJRH system, and yaml files that describe how they should be deployed. In general, services in the system are docker containers, and they are orchestrated using Docker's built in swarm tool.
